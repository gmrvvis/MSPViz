# MSPViz

## Introduction
MSPViz is a visualization tool for the Model of Structural Plasticity. It uses a visualisation technique  based on the representation of the neuronal information through the use of abstract levels and a set of schematic representations into each level. The multilevel structure and the design of the representations constitutes an approach that provides organized views that facilitates visual analysis tasks.

## Dependencies

  - Web Browser with HTML5 and JavaScript support (1) (2)
  - PHP 5.2 or above
  - Web Server (php CLI, SimpleHTTPServer, Apache2, ...)

(1) Chrome is the desired web browser as it offers the best performance when using the tool.  
(2) Web Browser extensions may interfere with the tools performance.
